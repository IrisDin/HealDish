# Our story：📖

People want to pursue a healthy life, but the price of healthy meals is not affordable for everyone, and the word "organic" tag on the product doubles the price of the food.

In society, everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life, regardless of their profession, race, or gender. This includes: 

**college students without family support**

**newly formed families facing many life pressures**

**people forced to work during the epidemic**
